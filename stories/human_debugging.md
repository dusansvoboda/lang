🚧 A2 STORY — “The SRE Who Had to Debug Himself”

(simple, clear, beginner-friendly English)

🛠️ The SRE Who Had to Debug Himself

Liam was an SRE who worked in a big company.
He was good at fixing servers, pipelines, and dashboards.
He could find a broken script in five minutes.
He could calm a noisy alert in ten seconds.
But he had one problem:

He could not debug himself.

One morning, Liam came to work tired.
Not normal tired — deep tired.
His mind felt slow.
His thoughts felt heavy.
Even his coffee did not help.

He opened his laptop.
The screen showed 27 new alerts.

Liam said:
“OK. I will fix the systems first.”

He typed fast. Too fast.
He closed the wrong pod.
He restarted a healthy service.
He confused staging with production.

Something was wrong — and it was not Kubernetes.

Liam stopped and took a breath.

He whispered:
“Maybe… I am the system that needs debugging.”

So he opened his notebook.
He wrote a simple checklist:

CPU (Brain) — low speed

Memory — too many thoughts

Logs — unclear messages

Load — too much work

Health check — failing

He looked at the list and laughed softly.
It was true.
He was overloaded.

Liam stood up.
He took a short walk outside.
He felt the cold air on his face.
He breathed slowly.
For the first time in weeks, he relaxed.

When he returned, he fixed the real system quickly.
His mind was clear again.

Before leaving work, he wrote a new alert rule:

If Liam_CPU < 30% for 24 hours → send message:
“Take a break, human.”

And for the first time, Liam created a ticket…
for himself.

He called it:

“Improve Self-Observability — High Priority.”
