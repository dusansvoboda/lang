IN 1995 RESEARCHERS from Carnegie Mellon University drove 3,000 miles from Pittsburgh to San Diego without their hands on the steering wheel. The “No Hands Across America” tour marked the start of a long road trip towards autonomous driving in America. Thirty years later you can, at last, see the fruits of that journey in the proliferation of self-driving cabs in several cities across America. Soon they will be braving the less predictable weather—and the left side of the roads—in London and Tokyo.

The number of American cities on the robotaxi roadmap is rising fast. Alphabet-owned Waymo, which has the world’s biggest fleet of 2,500 autonomous cars, provides paid rides in five places—Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix and the San Francisco Bay Area—and plans to more than double that number next year. Elon Musk’s Tesla has expanded its rudimentary robotaxi service (which still has a human “safety monitor” in the car) from Austin to San Francisco. Zoox, an Amazon-owned company that has built a quirky-looking cab without a steering wheel or pedals, offers autonomous ride-hailing in Las Vegas and has just launched in parts of San Francisco. Like Doctor Dolittle’s pushmi-pullyu, it can go in both directions.

Many people still have concerns about the technology. In a recent YouGov survey, three-quarters of Americans said they had little or no trust in self-driving taxis. Yet their misgivings may be at least in part the result of unfamiliarity. Another poll by J.D. Power, a consumer-research firm, found that confidence was 56 percentage points higher among those who had ridden in a robotaxi than those who had not. What is more, the number of people who have given one a try is growing speedily. In April Waymo surpassed 1m monthly active users (MAUs), according to Sensor Tower, a data provider, more than a ten-fold increase in two years (see chart).

Waymo and its competitors are not the only companies lured in by the promise of the technology. Others looking to cash in include traditional ride-hailers such as Uber, carmakers such as Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, and technology suppliers such as Nvidia—not to mention the vibrant robotaxi ecosystem emerging in China.

They are betting that the market for self-driving technology will prove to be vast. Americans currently spend around $50bn a year on ride-hailing. Then there is the possibility of selling self-driving software to carmakers and manufacturers of other vehicles, such as long-haul trucks and delivery vans. Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive, has said that the market for self-driving technology could be worth $1trn or more in America alone. That raises two questions: when will the autonomous revolution hit full speed; and who will come out ahead?

To answer these questions, start with the technology. It is easy to forget the miracle of a self-driving car when sitting in a Waymo or a Zoox, because it quickly feels so familiar that you forget your life is in the hands of a computer on wheels. Unlike other robots that operate in clean, controlled environments such as factories, robotaxis have to deal with the messiness of everyday life—road rage, clueless pedestrians and pets, and weather conditions like snow that can be as soft as slush or hard as a brick wall.

Several innovations have combined to make that possible. Robotaxis rely on sensors such as cameras, laser-based lidars, microphones and radars to assess road conditions, judge distances and manage speed. They then use artificial intelligence both in the car and in the cloud to mimic the way human drivers process such information and react to it. And as robotaxi services have expanded, they have hoovered up ever more data, allowing them to refine their algorithms. The rise of multi-modal generative-AI models, which weave together text, images and sounds, has also accelerated progress, including by making it easier to train autonomous systems using simulations and teach them to react to unusual situations.

For the industry, building confidence that self-driving vehicles are safe is vital. Research conducted last year by Waymo with Swiss Re, an insurance giant, showed that its robotaxis generated 88% fewer property-damage claims and 92% fewer bodily-injury claims than the average human during 25m miles of driving, a performance which has improved further since. But public trust is easily shattered. A grisly accident in 2023 involving a robotaxi operated by Cruise, a competitor to Waymo, became existential after the company failed to provide full transparency during a federal investigation. General Motors, Cruise’s owner, subsequently shut its robotaxi service down.

Such incidents risk setting back the industry’s efforts to win over policymakers. Under President Donald Trump, the Department of Transportation has said it will develop federal regulations for autonomous vehicles, including robotaxis. But there are still myriad state-by-state rules (California has two agencies that regulate robotaxis). Some cities such as Seattle put up roadblocks as well. “Everything we do today is to build trust and safety, and we can’t scale the technology without that,” says Chris Mooney, a Waymo executive.

Still, the speed at which Waymo is accelerating its city-by-city rollout suggests it is becoming increasingly confident in the safety of its service. Turning it into a profitable business, however, is another matter. Human drivers are estimated to account for 50-70% of the cost of a traditional ride-hailing service such as Uber, so stripping them out sounds like a quick way to undercut the incumbents. Yet all robotaxi services currently lose money, including Waymo. (In addition to receiving fistfuls of cash from Alphabet, the company raised $5.6bn in a share offering to outside investors last year.)

That is partly because their vehicles are expensive; they are kitted out with costly safety features and trained on pricey AI chips. And unlike ride-hailing firms such as Uber, which rely on owner-drivers, robotaxi operators have to cover the cost both of acquiring and managing their fleets, including cleaning, fuel, maintenance and parking. They also need human supervisors to monitor their vehicles in case things go wrong.

As a result, Augustin Wegsheider of BCG, a consultancy, estimates that self-driving vehicles cost about $7-9 a mile to operate, compared with $2-3 a mile for traditional ride-hailers and $1 a mile for personal cars. Cutting costs “has not been a priority of the robotaxi companies so far”, says Philipp Kampshoff of McKinsey, another consultancy. “They haven’t even scratched the surface, because mission number one was making the operation safe.” McKinsey estimates that it will take a decade to bring costs below $2 a mile.

Cheaper hardware will contribute. Estimates for the cost of Waymo’s current generation of robotaxis range from $130,000 to $200,000 each. Using the sporty Jaguar I-Pace as the starting point hasn’t helped to keep costs down. This month the company started testing the more modest Hyundai IONIQ 5, equipped with Waymo’s newer generation of self-driving technology which requires fewer sensors. The cost of those sensors is coming down, too. American-made lidars that used to cost around $100,000 are now little more than $1,000.

The economics of robotaxis can be improved in other ways. To keep utilisation of its vehicles high, Waymo’s approach to expansion has been to deploy a relatively small number of cabs in several markets, rather than trying to saturate one in particular, though the tactic has obvious limits. Instead of managing all its vehicles, it is also starting to forge alliances with fleet operators, such as Avis, a car-rental firm, to help handle day-to-day operations.
Off to the races

Once robotaxis prove to be sufficiently safe and no more expensive than a human-driven cab, demand may accelerate rapidly. The question then is who will conquer the market. For now, Waymo is clearly the front-runner, at least in America. Its self-driving technology has been designated as Level 4, which means that in pre-approved areas its vehicles can operate without direct human supervision, whereas Tesla’s robotaxis are between Levels 2 and 3, meaning they still need a supervisor in the car. Because of Waymo’s focus on safety, it has kitted out its cars with more expensive hardware than Tesla. For instance, its latest vehicles have 13 cameras, six radars and four lidars, whereas Tesla relies solely on eight cameras. That has helped Waymo win over regulators.

Ali Kani of Nvidia, which sells AI chips to all comers in the robotaxi race, suggests that once Waymo has proved the safety case “without hiccups”, it may be able to cut costs by shedding some of the hardware. For his part, Mr Musk is betting that Tesla’s approach of relying solely on cameras and AI-enabled software will give it the edge as its technology improves, with less hardware making its robotaxis cheaper than Waymo’s.

For now, both Waymo and Tesla are keeping their technology close to their chests. In time, that may change. Waymo could take inspiration from another Alphabet endeavour—the Android operating system—and try to license its software to others. Mr Musk has said he may do the same with Tesla’s self-driving technology. Aicha Evans, the chief executive of Zoox, says it intends to remain a fully integrated robotaxi service. But some reckon its self-driving technology could also be used in Amazon’s logistics operations. Other firms such as Wayve, a British startup backed by Nvidia and SoftBank, a Japanese investor, have opted to focus on self-driving software, rather than offering an integrated robotaxi service with all the cost and complexity that entails. Earlier this year it announced it would start selling its technology to Nissan, a Japanese carmaker.

Robotaxi providers will also have to decide how to work with the big ride-hailing companies, particularly Uber. In 2020 it abandoned an effort to develop its own self-driving technology, but has since set its sights on becoming the preferred booking platform for robotaxis. In some cities, such as Phoenix, it already takes bookings on behalf of Waymo. Elsewhere it is hoping to compete. It has struck a deal with Lucid, an electric-vehicle maker, and Nuro, which builds self-driving systems, to roll out 20,000 robotaxis over the next six years. It also plans to enter London in partnership with Wayve and a yet-to-be-named carmaker.

Uber’s bet is that human drivers and robotaxis will co-exist for years to come. Eventually, however, robotaxis will become the cheaper option, says Sarfraz Maredia, Uber’s head of autonomy, which is why the company is manoeuvring itself into position now. Its customer base gives it a big advantage; Sensor Tower reckons Uber has 42m MAUs, dwarfing Waymo.

Then there is Nvidia. Perhaps predictably, the AI revolution’s biggest beneficiary is carving out a role for itself as an essential supplier for self-driving vehicles. Alongside Uber, it is supporting carmakers that are developing autonomous systems of their own, including Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis (whose largest shareholder, Exor, owns a stake in The Economist’s parent company). At the same time, it is selling vast numbers of graphics-processing units (GPUs) to Waymo to run its AI simulations, and sit inside its cars to process the data pouring in from their sensors and calculate how to respond. Tesla has likewise spent billions of dollars training its AI systems on 100,000 Nvidia GPUs. It won’t be an Nvidia cab that rolls up to people’s doors. But the world’s most valuable company will be sure to take its cut of the fare. ■

TRADUCTION COMPLÈTE EN FRANÇAIS

En 1995, des chercheurs de l’université Carnegie Mellon parcoururent 3 000 miles, de Pittsburgh à San Diego, sans poser les mains sur le volant. Leur tournée « No Hands Across America » marqua le début d’un long voyage vers la conduite autonome aux États-Unis. Trente ans plus tard, on peut enfin constater les fruits de ce périple avec la prolifération de taxis autonomes dans plusieurs villes américaines. Bientôt, ils affronteront aussi une météo plus imprévisible—et la conduite à gauche—à Londres et à Tokyo.

Le nombre de villes américaines inscrites sur la feuille de route des robotaxis augmente rapidement. Waymo, filiale d’Alphabet et propriétaire de la plus grande flotte mondiale de 2 500 voitures autonomes, propose des courses payantes dans cinq endroits—Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix et la région de la baie de San Francisco—et prévoit de plus que doubler ce nombre l’année prochaine. Tesla, d’Elon Musk, a étendu son service rudimentaire de robotaxis (qui inclut encore un « superviseur de sécurité » humain dans la voiture) d’Austin à San Francisco. Zoox, une entreprise appartenant à Amazon, qui a construit un taxi à l’allure étrange sans volant ni pédales, propose un service autonome à Las Vegas et vient de se lancer dans certaines zones de San Francisco. Comme la créature « pushmi-pullyu » du docteur Dolittle, il peut avancer dans les deux directions.

Beaucoup de gens demeurent préoccupés par cette technologie. Dans un récent sondage YouGov, trois quarts des Américains ont déclaré avoir peu ou pas confiance dans les taxis autonomes. Pourtant, leurs réticences proviennent peut-être en partie d’un manque de familiarité. Un autre sondage, réalisé par J.D. Power, a montré que la confiance était supérieure de 56 points de pourcentage parmi ceux ayant déjà emprunté un robotaxi, comparés à ceux qui ne l’avaient jamais fait. De plus, le nombre de personnes ayant essayé ce mode de transport augmente rapidement. En avril, Waymo a dépassé 1 million d’utilisateurs actifs mensuels, selon Sensor Tower, soit une multiplication par dix en deux ans.

Waymo et ses concurrents ne sont pas les seules entreprises attirées par les promesses de cette technologie. Parmi les autres acteurs désireux de tirer profit du secteur figurent des sociétés de VTC comme Uber, des constructeurs automobiles comme Mercedes-Benz et Volkswagen, ainsi que des fournisseurs technologiques tels que Nvidia—sans oublier l’écosystème robotaxi dynamique qui émerge en Chine.

Ils parient que le marché de la technologie autonome sera immense. Les Américains dépensent actuellement environ 50 milliards de dollars par an en services de VTC. Il existe aussi la possibilité de vendre des logiciels de conduite autonome aux constructeurs automobiles et aux fabricants d’autres types de véhicules, comme les camions longue distance et les fourgonnettes de livraison. Dara Khosrowshahi, directeur général d’Uber, estime que le marché de la conduite autonome pourrait valoir 1 000 milliards de dollars ou davantage rien qu’aux États-Unis. Cela soulève deux questions : quand la révolution autonome atteindra-t-elle sa pleine vitesse, et qui prendra l’avantage ?

Pour répondre à ces questions, il faut commencer par la technologie. Il est facile d’oublier le caractère miraculeux d’une voiture autonome lorsqu’on s’assied dans une Waymo ou une Zoox, car elle paraît rapidement si familière qu’on oublie que sa vie dépend d’un ordinateur monté sur roues. Contrairement à d’autres robots opérant dans des environnements propres et contrôlés, comme les usines, les robotaxis doivent gérer le désordre du monde réel—la colère des conducteurs, les piétons distraits, les animaux domestiques, et des conditions météorologiques telles que la neige, qui peut être aussi douce que la gadoue ou aussi dure qu’un mur de briques.

Plusieurs innovations ont rendu cela possible. Les robotaxis reposent sur des capteurs tels que des caméras, des lidars à base de lasers, des microphones et des radars pour analyser les conditions routières, évaluer les distances et gérer la vitesse. Ils utilisent ensuite l’intelligence artificielle, tant dans la voiture que dans le cloud, pour imiter la manière dont les conducteurs humains traitent ces informations et y réagissent. Et à mesure que les services de robotaxis ont pris de l’ampleur, ils ont aspiré toujours plus de données, leur permettant d’affiner leurs algorithmes. L’essor de modèles d’IA générative multimodaux, combinant texte, images et sons, a également accéléré les progrès, notamment en facilitant l’entraînement des systèmes autonomes grâce à des simulations et en leur apprenant à réagir à des situations inhabituelles.

Pour l’industrie, établir la confiance dans la sécurité des véhicules autonomes est vital. Une étude menée l’an dernier par Waymo avec Swiss Re, géant de l’assurance, a montré que ses robotaxis généraient 88 % de sinistres matériels en moins et 92 % de sinistres corporels en moins que la moyenne humaine sur 25 millions de miles parcourus—une performance qui s’est encore améliorée depuis. Mais la confiance du public est facilement brisée. Un accident macabre en 2023 impliquant un robotaxi de Cruise, concurrent de Waymo, a tourné au désastre après que l’entreprise a omis de fournir une transparence totale lors d’une enquête fédérale. General Motors, propriétaire de Cruise, a ensuite fermé son service de robotaxis.

De tels incidents risquent de compromettre les efforts du secteur pour convaincre les décideurs politiques. Sous la présidence de Donald Trump, le département des Transports a déclaré qu’il élaborerait une réglementation fédérale pour les véhicules autonomes, y compris les robotaxis. Mais les règles varient toujours énormément d’un État à l’autre (la Californie compte deux agences qui réglementent les robotaxis). Certaines villes comme Seattle dressent également des obstacles. « Tout ce que nous faisons aujourd’hui vise à renforcer la confiance et la sécurité, et nous ne pouvons pas développer la technologie sans cela », explique Chris Mooney, cadre chez Waymo.

Toutefois, la rapidité avec laquelle Waymo étend son déploiement ville par ville suggère que l’entreprise devient de plus en plus confiante dans la sécurité de son service. En faire une activité rentable est toutefois une autre affaire. On estime que les conducteurs humains représentent 50 à 70 % du coût d’un service de VTC traditionnel comme Uber ; les supprimer semble donc être un moyen rapide de battre les acteurs existants sur les prix. Pourtant, tous les services de robotaxis perdent actuellement de l’argent, y compris Waymo. (En plus des financements massifs fournis par Alphabet, l’entreprise a levé 5,6 milliards de dollars auprès d’investisseurs externes l’année dernière.)

Cela s’explique en partie par le coût élevé de leurs véhicules : ils sont équipés de technologies de sécurité onéreuses et formés sur des puces d’IA coûteuses. Et contrairement à Uber, qui s’appuie sur des conducteurs propriétaires de leurs véhicules, les opérateurs de robotaxis doivent assumer les coûts d’acquisition et de gestion de leurs flottes, y compris le nettoyage, le carburant, l’entretien et le stationnement. Ils ont également besoin de superviseurs humains pour surveiller les véhicules en cas de problème.

Ainsi, Augustin Wegscheider, du cabinet de conseil BCG, estime que les véhicules autonomes coûtent environ 7 à 9 dollars par mile à exploiter, contre 2 à 3 dollars pour les VTC traditionnels et 1 dollar pour une voiture personnelle. Réduire les coûts « n’a pas été la priorité des entreprises de robotaxis jusqu’à présent », explique Philipp Kampshoff, de McKinsey, un autre cabinet de conseil. « Elles n’ont même pas commencé, car la priorité numéro un était de rendre l’opération sûre. » McKinsey estime qu’il faudra une décennie pour faire descendre les coûts en dessous de 2 dollars par mile.

Du matériel plus abordable contribuera à cette baisse. Les estimations du coût de la génération actuelle de robotaxis Waymo varient entre 130 000 et 200 000 dollars l’unité. Utiliser une Jaguar I-Pace sportive comme base n’a pas aidé à réduire les coûts. Ce mois-ci, l’entreprise a commencé à tester la Hyundai IONIQ 5, un modèle plus modeste équipé d’une nouvelle génération de technologie autonome nécessitant moins de capteurs. Le coût de ces capteurs baisse lui aussi : les lidars fabriqués aux États-Unis, qui coûtaient autrefois environ 100 000 dollars, valent désormais un peu plus de 1 000 dollars.

L’économie des robotaxis peut être améliorée de plusieurs façons. Pour maintenir une forte utilisation de ses véhicules, Waymo a choisi de déployer un nombre relativement limité de taxis dans plusieurs marchés, au lieu de saturer un seul, bien que cette tactique ait des limites évidentes. L’entreprise commence également à nouer des partenariats avec des opérateurs de flotte tels qu’Avis, pour l’aider à gérer les opérations quotidiennes.

Une fois que les robotaxis auront prouvé qu’ils sont suffisamment sûrs et pas plus chers qu’un taxi conduit par un humain, la demande pourrait augmenter rapidement. La question est alors de savoir qui dominera le marché. Pour l’instant, Waymo est clairement en tête, du moins en Amérique. Sa technologie de conduite autonome a été classée au niveau 4, ce qui signifie que, dans des zones pré-approuvées, ses véhicules peuvent fonctionner sans supervision humaine directe, tandis que les robotaxis de Tesla se situent entre les niveaux 2 et 3, ce qui implique qu’un superviseur reste nécessaire dans la voiture. En raison de son accent sur la sécurité, Waymo a équipé ses véhicules de matériel plus coûteux que Tesla. Par exemple, ses derniers modèles disposent de 13 caméras, six radars et quatre lidars, alors que Tesla s’appuie uniquement sur huit caméras. Cela a aidé Waymo à obtenir la faveur des régulateurs.

Ali Kani, de Nvidia, qui vend des puces d’IA à tous les acteurs de la course aux robotaxis, suggère qu’une fois que Waymo aura prouvé la sûreté de son système « sans accroc », elle pourra réduire les coûts en supprimant une partie du matériel. Pour sa part, M. Musk parie que l’approche de Tesla, qui repose uniquement sur des caméras et un logiciel d’IA, lui donnera l’avantage à mesure que sa technologie s’améliorera, rendant ses robotaxis moins chers que ceux de Waymo.

Pour l’instant, Waymo et Tesla gardent leur technologie bien secrète. Avec le temps, cela pourrait changer. Waymo pourrait s’inspirer d’un autre projet d’Alphabet—le système d’exploitation Android—et chercher à licencier son logiciel. M. Musk a déclaré qu’il pourrait faire de même avec la technologie autonome de Tesla. Aicha Evans, directrice générale de Zoox, affirme que l’entreprise prévoit de rester un service de robotaxis entièrement intégré. Mais certains estiment que sa technologie autonome pourrait également être utilisée dans les opérations logistiques d’Amazon. D’autres entreprises, comme Wayve, une start-up britannique soutenue par Nvidia et SoftBank, ont choisi de se concentrer sur le logiciel autonome plutôt que sur un service de robotaxis complet, avec tout le coût et la complexité que cela implique. Plus tôt cette année, elle a annoncé qu’elle commencerait à vendre sa technologie au constructeur japonais Nissan.

Les fournisseurs de robotaxis devront également décider comment coopérer avec les grandes sociétés de VTC, notamment Uber. En 2020, Uber a abandonné ses efforts pour développer sa propre technologie autonome, mais vise désormais à devenir la plateforme de réservation privilégiée pour les robotaxis. Dans certaines villes, comme Phoenix, elle prend déjà des réservations au nom de Waymo. Ailleurs, elle espère concurrencer directement. Elle a conclu un accord avec Lucid, fabricant de véhicules électriques, et Nuro, développeur de systèmes autonomes, pour déployer 20 000 robotaxis au cours des six prochaines années. Elle prévoit également d’entrer sur le marché de Londres en partenariat avec Wayve et un constructeur automobile encore non nommé.

Uber parie que les conducteurs humains et les robotaxis coexisteront pendant de nombreuses années. Cependant, à terme, les robotaxis deviendront l’option la moins chère, affirme Sarfraz Maredia, responsable de l’autonomie chez Uber, raison pour laquelle l’entreprise se positionne dès maintenant. Sa base de clients lui offre un énorme avantage ; Sensor Tower estime qu’Uber compte 42 millions d’utilisateurs actifs mensuels, bien plus que Waymo.

Enfin, il y a Nvidia. Sans surprise, le plus grand bénéficiaire de la révolution de l’IA s’impose comme un fournisseur essentiel de véhicules autonomes. Aux côtés d’Uber, elle soutient des constructeurs développant leurs propres systèmes autonomes, notamment Mercedes-Benz et Stellantis (dont l’actionnaire principal, Exor, détient une participation dans la société mère de The Economist). En parallèle, Nvidia vend un nombre colossal de processeurs graphiques (GPU) à Waymo pour exécuter ses simulations d’IA, et équipe également ses voitures afin de traiter les données provenant des capteurs et calculer les réactions du véhicule. Tesla a également dépensé des milliards de dollars pour entraîner ses systèmes d’IA sur 100 000 GPU Nvidia. Ce ne sera pas un taxi Nvidia qui viendra chercher les clients. Mais l’entreprise la plus valorisée du monde ne manquera pas de prélever sa part du trajet. ■

VOLLSTÄNDIGE DEUTSCHE ÜBERSETZUNG

Im Jahr 1995 fuhren Forscher der Carnegie Mellon University 3.000 Meilen von Pittsburgh nach San Diego, ohne dabei ihre Hände auf das Lenkrad zu legen. Die Tour namens „No Hands Across America“ markierte den Beginn einer langen Reise in Richtung autonomes Fahren in den Vereinigten Staaten. Dreißig Jahre später kann man endlich die Früchte dieser Reise sehen: die zunehmende Verbreitung selbstfahrender Taxis in mehreren amerikanischen Städten. Bald werden sie sich auch dem weniger vorhersehbaren Wetter—und der linken Straßenseite—in London und Tokio stellen.

Die Zahl der amerikanischen Städte auf der „Robotaxi-Roadmap“ steigt rasant. Waymo, ein Unternehmen im Besitz von Alphabet, das die weltweit größte Flotte von 2.500 autonomen Autos betreibt, bietet bezahlte Fahrten an fünf Orten an—Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix und der San-Francisco-Buchtregion—und plant, diese Zahl im nächsten Jahr mehr als zu verdoppeln. Elon Musks Tesla hat seinen rudimentären Robotaxi-Dienst (bei dem sich weiterhin ein menschlicher „Sicherheitsbeobachter“ im Auto befindet) von Austin nach San Francisco ausgeweitet. Zoox, ein zu Amazon gehörendes Unternehmen, das ein ungewöhnlich aussehendes Taxi ohne Lenkrad und Pedale gebaut hat, bietet autonome Fahrten in Las Vegas an und hat kürzlich in Teilen von San Francisco gestartet. Wie das pushmi-pullyu aus den Geschichten von Dr. Dolittle kann es in beide Richtungen fahren.

Viele Menschen haben weiterhin Bedenken hinsichtlich der Technologie. In einer aktuellen YouGov-Umfrage gaben drei Viertel der Amerikaner an, dass sie selbstfahrenden Taxis wenig oder gar nicht vertrauen. Doch ihre Vorbehalte sind möglicherweise zumindest teilweise auf mangelnde Erfahrung zurückzuführen. Eine weitere Umfrage des Verbraucherforschungsunternehmens J.D. Power ergab, dass das Vertrauen unter denjenigen, die bereits mit einem Robotaxi gefahren waren, um 56 Prozentpunkte höher war als bei jenen, die es noch nicht versucht hatten. Zudem wächst die Zahl der Menschen, die eine Probefahrt gemacht haben, rasant. Im April überschritt Waymo laut Sensor Tower, einem Datenanbieter, die Marke von 1 Million monatlich aktiven Nutzern—eine Verzehnfachung innerhalb von zwei Jahren.

Waymo und seine Wettbewerber sind nicht die einzigen Unternehmen, die vom Potenzial der Technologie angelockt werden. Weitere Interessenten sind traditionelle Fahrdienstvermittler wie Uber, Automobilhersteller wie Mercedes-Benz und Volkswagen sowie Technologielieferanten wie Nvidia—ganz zu schweigen vom lebhaften Robotaxi-Ökosystem, das in China entsteht.

Sie setzen darauf, dass der Markt für selbstfahrende Technologien gewaltig sein wird. Amerikaner geben derzeit rund 50 Milliarden Dollar pro Jahr für Fahrdienste aus. Hinzu kommt die Möglichkeit, Software für autonomes Fahren an Autohersteller und Hersteller anderer Fahrzeugtypen zu verkaufen, etwa für Langstrecken-LKWs und Lieferwagen. Dara Khosrowshahi, der Chef von Uber, hat gesagt, dass der Markt für selbstfahrende Technologie allein in Amerika einen Wert von einer Billion Dollar oder mehr haben könnte. Das wirft zwei Fragen auf: Wann wird die autonome Revolution volle Fahrt aufnehmen? Und wer wird am Ende vorne liegen?

Um diese Fragen zu beantworten, muss man bei der Technologie beginnen. Es ist leicht zu vergessen, wie erstaunlich ein selbstfahrendes Auto ist, wenn man in einem Waymo oder einem Zoox sitzt, denn es fühlt sich schnell so vertraut an, dass man vergisst, dass das eigene Leben einem Computer auf Rädern anvertraut ist. Anders als andere Roboter, die in sauberen, kontrollierten Umgebungen wie Fabriken arbeiten, müssen Robotaxis mit dem Chaos des Alltags zurechtkommen—mit aggressiven Autofahrern, unaufmerksamen Fußgängern und Haustieren sowie mit Wetterbedingungen wie Schnee, der so weich wie Matsch oder so hart wie eine Ziegelwand sein kann.

Mehrere Innovationen haben dies möglich gemacht. Robotaxis verlassen sich auf Sensoren wie Kameras, laserbasierte Lidars, Mikrofone und Radare, um Straßenbedingungen zu erkennen, Entfernungen einzuschätzen und die Geschwindigkeit zu steuern. Sie nutzen dann künstliche Intelligenz sowohl im Fahrzeug als auch in der Cloud, um die Art und Weise nachzuahmen, wie menschliche Fahrer solche Informationen verarbeiten und darauf reagieren. Und je weiter die Robotaxi-Dienste expandiert sind, desto mehr Daten haben sie gesammelt, was es ihnen erlaubt hat, ihre Algorithmen zu verfeinern. Der Aufstieg multimodaler generativer KI-Modelle, die Texte, Bilder und Geräusche miteinander verknüpfen, hat den Fortschritt zusätzlich beschleunigt, unter anderem weil er das Training autonomer Systeme in Simulationen erleichtert und ihnen beibringt, auf ungewöhnliche Situationen zu reagieren.

Für die Branche ist es entscheidend, Vertrauen in die Sicherheit selbstfahrender Fahrzeuge aufzubauen. Eine im vergangenen Jahr von Waymo gemeinsam mit Swiss Re, einem Versicherungsgiganten, durchgeführte Studie zeigte, dass seine Robotaxis 88 % weniger Sachschäden und 92 % weniger Personenschäden verursachten als der durchschnittliche menschliche Fahrer auf 25 Millionen gefahrenen Meilen—eine Leistung, die sich seither weiter verbessert hat. Doch das Vertrauen der Öffentlichkeit ist leicht zu erschüttern. Ein grausiger Unfall im Jahr 2023, in den ein Robotaxi von Cruise verwickelt war, einem Waymo-Konkurrenten, wurde existenzbedrohend, nachdem das Unternehmen es versäumt hatte, während einer bundesstaatlichen Untersuchung vollständige Transparenz zu zeigen. General Motors, der Eigentümer von Cruise, stellte daraufhin seinen Robotaxi-Dienst ein.

Solche Vorfälle könnten die Bemühungen der Branche, politische Entscheidungsträger zu überzeugen, zurückwerfen. Unter Präsident Donald Trump hat das Verkehrsministerium angekündigt, dass es bundesweite Vorschriften für autonome Fahrzeuge einschließlich Robotaxis entwickeln werde. Doch weiterhin existieren zahlreiche unterschiedliche Regeln auf Ebene der Bundesstaaten (Kalifornien hat zwei Behörden, die Robotaxis regulieren). Auch einige Städte wie Seattle stellen sich quer. „Alles, was wir heute tun, dient dazu, Vertrauen und Sicherheit aufzubauen, und ohne das können wir die Technologie nicht skalieren“, sagt Chris Mooney, ein Waymo-Manager.

Nichtsdestotrotz deutet die Geschwindigkeit, mit der Waymo sein stadtweises Rollout beschleunigt, darauf hin, dass das Unternehmen zunehmend Vertrauen in die Sicherheit seines Dienstes gewinnt. Es in ein profitables Geschäftsmodell zu verwandeln, ist jedoch eine andere Frage. Schätzungen zufolge machen menschliche Fahrer 50–70 % der Kosten eines traditionellen Fahrdienstes wie Uber aus, weshalb es zunächst verlockend klingt, sie zu eliminieren, um die etablierten Anbieter zu unterbieten. Doch derzeit verlieren alle Robotaxi-Dienste Geld, einschließlich Waymo. (Neben den massiven Investitionen von Alphabet hat das Unternehmen im vergangenen Jahr 5,6 Milliarden Dollar von externen Investoren eingeworben.)

Das liegt zum Teil daran, dass ihre Fahrzeuge teuer sind; sie sind mit kostspieligen Sicherheitsfunktionen ausgestattet und werden auf teuren KI-Chips trainiert. Und im Gegensatz zu Fahrdiensten wie Uber, die sich auf Fahrer mit eigenen Fahrzeugen stützen, müssen Robotaxi-Betreiber sowohl die Anschaffung als auch den Betrieb ihrer Flotten finanzieren, einschließlich Reinigung, Treibstoff, Wartung und Parken. Außerdem benötigen sie menschliche Aufsichtspersonen, die die Fahrzeuge überwachen, falls etwas schiefgeht.

Daher schätzt Augustin Wegscheider von der Unternehmensberatung BCG, dass selbstfahrende Fahrzeuge etwa 7–9 Dollar pro Meile kosten, verglichen mit 2–3 Dollar pro Meile bei traditionellen Fahrdiensten und etwa 1 Dollar pro Meile für Privatfahrzeuge. Kostenreduzierung „war bisher nicht die Priorität der Robotaxi-Unternehmen“, sagt Philipp Kampshoff von McKinsey, einer weiteren Beratung. „Sie haben nicht einmal an der Oberfläche gekratzt, weil Mission Nummer eins darin bestand, den Betrieb sicher zu machen.“ McKinsey schätzt, dass es ein Jahrzehnt dauern wird, die Kosten auf unter 2 Dollar pro Meile zu senken.

Günstigere Hardware wird ihren Teil dazu beitragen. Die Kosten für die aktuelle Generation der Waymo-Robotaxis werden auf 130.000 bis 200.000 Dollar geschätzt. Dass als Ausgangspunkt das sportliche Modell Jaguar I-Pace verwendet wurde, hat nicht geholfen, die Kosten zu senken. In diesem Monat begann das Unternehmen, das bescheidenere Modell Hyundai IONIQ 5 zu testen, das mit Waymos neuerer Generation autonomer Technologie ausgestattet ist, die weniger Sensoren benötigt. Auch der Preis dieser Sensoren sinkt: Amerikanisch hergestellte Lidars, die früher um die 100.000 Dollar kosteten, liegen nun knapp über 1.000 Dollar.

Die Robotaxi-Ökonomie lässt sich auch auf andere Weise verbessern. Um die Auslastung seiner Fahrzeuge hoch zu halten, setzt Waymo bei seiner Expansion darauf, eine relativ kleine Anzahl von Taxis in mehreren Märkten zu stationieren, statt einen einzigen Markt vollständig zu dominieren—auch wenn diese Strategie offensichtliche Grenzen hat. Statt alle Fahrzeuge selbst zu betreiben, beginnt das Unternehmen außerdem, Allianzen mit Flottenbetreibern wie Avis einzugehen, um bei alltäglichen betrieblichen Aufgaben Unterstützung zu erhalten.

Sobald Robotaxis als ausreichend sicher gelten und nicht teurer sind als ein von einem Menschen gefahrenes Taxi, könnte die Nachfrage schnell steigen. Dann stellt sich die Frage, wer den Markt erobern wird. Derzeit ist Waymo eindeutig der Spitzenreiter, zumindest in Amerika. Seine Technologie für autonomes Fahren wurde als „Level 4“ eingestuft, was bedeutet, dass seine Fahrzeuge in vorab genehmigten Gebieten ohne direkte menschliche Aufsicht betrieben werden können, während Teslas Robotaxis zwischen Level 2 und 3 liegen, sodass weiterhin ein menschlicher Aufpasser im Auto notwendig ist. Aufgrund seines Fokus auf Sicherheit hat Waymo seine Fahrzeuge mit teurerer Hardware ausgestattet als Tesla. So verfügen seine neuesten Modelle über 13 Kameras, sechs Radare und vier Lidars, während sich Tesla ausschließlich auf acht Kameras stützt. Das hat Waymo geholfen, bei Regulierungsbehörden zu punkten.

Ali Kani von Nvidia, das KI-Chips an alle Akteure im Robotaxi-Wettbewerb verkauft, schlägt vor, dass Waymo, sobald es seine Sicherheit „ohne Zwischenfälle“ bewiesen hat, möglicherweise Kosten senken kann, indem es einen Teil der Hardware entfernt. Musk wiederum setzt darauf, dass Teslas Ansatz, ausschließlich auf Kameras und KI-Software zu vertrauen, überlegen sein wird, da seine Technologie verbessert wird—was Teslas Robotaxis günstiger machen würde als die von Waymo.

Derzeit halten sowohl Waymo als auch Tesla ihre Technologie streng unter Verschluss. Das könnte sich jedoch im Laufe der Zeit ändern. Waymo könnte sich von einem anderen Alphabet-Projekt inspirieren lassen—vom Android-Betriebssystem—und versuchen, seine Software zu lizenzieren. Musk hat gesagt, er könnte dasselbe mit Teslas autonomer Technologie tun. Aicha Evans, CEO von Zoox, sagt, das Unternehmen wolle ein vollständig integrierter Robotaxi-Dienst bleiben. Doch einige Branchenbeobachter glauben, dass die selbstfahrende Technologie von Zoox auch im Logistikbetrieb von Amazon eingesetzt werden könnte. Andere Unternehmen wie Wayve, ein britisches Startup, das von Nvidia und SoftBank unterstützt wird, haben sich dafür entschieden, sich auf Software für autonomes Fahren zu konzentrieren, statt einen integrierten Robotaxi-Dienst anzubieten—mit all den Kosten und der Komplexität, die dieser mit sich bringt. Anfang dieses Jahres kündigte Wayve an, seine Technologie an den japanischen Autohersteller Nissan zu verkaufen.

Robotaxi-Anbieter müssen auch entscheiden, wie sie mit großen Fahrdienstplattformen wie Uber zusammenarbeiten wollen. 2020 stellte Uber seine eigenen Bemühungen zur Entwicklung autonomer Technologie ein, strebt aber inzwischen danach, zur bevorzugten Buchungsplattform für Robotaxis zu werden. In einigen Städten, etwa Phoenix, nimmt Uber bereits Buchungen im Namen von Waymo entgegen. Anderswo hofft das Unternehmen, in Konkurrenz zu treten. Es hat eine Vereinbarung mit dem Elektrofahrzeughersteller Lucid und mit Nuro, einem Entwickler autonomer Systeme, getroffen, um in den nächsten sechs Jahren 20.000 Robotaxis einzusetzen. Zudem plant es den Einstieg in London in Partnerschaft mit Wayve und einem noch nicht genannten Autohersteller.

Uber setzt darauf, dass menschliche Fahrer und Robotaxis noch viele Jahre nebeneinander bestehen werden. Langfristig jedoch werden Robotaxis die günstigere Option sein, sagt Sarfraz Maredia, Ubers Leiter für Autonomie—und deshalb positioniert sich das Unternehmen schon jetzt. Seine große Kundenbasis verschafft ihm einen erheblichen Vorteil; laut Sensor Tower hat Uber 42 Millionen monatlich aktive Nutzer, viel mehr als Waymo.

Und schließlich gibt es Nvidia. Wie zu erwarten, schafft sich der größte Profiteur der KI-Revolution eine zentrale Rolle als unverzichtbarer Lieferant für autonome Fahrzeuge. Gemeinsam mit Uber unterstützt Nvidia Autohersteller, die eigene autonome Systeme entwickeln, darunter Mercedes-Benz und Stellantis (dessen größter Aktionär, Exor, eine Beteiligung an der Muttergesellschaft des Economist hält). Gleichzeitig verkauft Nvidia enorme Mengen an Grafikprozessoren (GPUs) an Waymo, damit diese ihre KI-Simulationen ausführen können, und stattet dessen Fahrzeuge mit Chips aus, die die eingehenden Sensordaten verarbeiten und Entscheidungen treffen. Tesla wiederum hat Milliarden von Dollar ausgegeben, um seine KI-Systeme auf 100.000 Nvidia-GPUs zu trainieren. Es wird kein Robotaxi mit Nvidia-Logo sein, das vorfährt—aber das wertvollste Unternehmen der Welt wird sicher seinen Anteil an jeder Fahrt bekommen. ■

TRADUZIONE COMPLETA IN ITALIANO

Nel 1995, alcuni ricercatori della Carnegie Mellon University percorsero 3.000 miglia da Pittsburgh a San Diego senza mettere le mani sul volante. Il tour “No Hands Across America” segnò l’inizio di un lungo viaggio verso la guida autonoma negli Stati Uniti. Trent’anni dopo si possono finalmente vedere i frutti di quel percorso nella proliferazione di taxi autonomi in diverse città americane. Presto affronteranno anche un clima meno prevedibile—e la guida a sinistra—a Londra e Tokyo.

Il numero di città americane presenti sulla mappa dei robotaxi sta crescendo rapidamente. Waymo, di proprietà di Alphabet e dotata della più grande flotta al mondo con 2.500 auto autonome, offre corse a pagamento in cinque località—Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix e l’area della baia di San Francisco—e prevede di più che raddoppiare questo numero il prossimo anno. Tesla di Elon Musk ha ampliato il suo servizio ancora rudimentale di robotaxi (che prevede comunque un “supervisore di sicurezza” umano a bordo) da Austin a San Francisco. Zoox, un’azienda di Amazon che ha costruito un taxi dall’aspetto insolito senza volante né pedali, offre tratte autonome a Las Vegas e ha appena debuttato in alcune zone di San Francisco. Come il “pushmi-pullyu” del Dottor Dolittle, può avanzare in entrambe le direzioni.

Molte persone nutrono ancora preoccupazioni riguardo alla tecnologia. In un recente sondaggio YouGov, tre quarti degli americani hanno dichiarato di avere poca o nessuna fiducia nei taxi autonomi. Tuttavia, le loro riserve potrebbero derivare almeno in parte dalla scarsa familiarità con il sistema. Un altro sondaggio, realizzato da J.D. Power, ha rilevato che la fiducia era superiore di 56 punti percentuali tra coloro che avevano già utilizzato un robotaxi rispetto a chi non l’aveva mai fatto. Inoltre, il numero di persone che li hanno provati sta crescendo rapidamente. Ad aprile Waymo ha superato 1 milione di utenti attivi mensili, secondo Sensor Tower, un fornitore di dati—più di dieci volte rispetto a due anni prima.

Waymo e i suoi concorrenti non sono le uniche aziende attratte dalle promesse della tecnologia. Altri attori desiderosi di approfittarne includono servizi di ride-hailing come Uber, case automobilistiche come Mercedes-Benz e Volkswagen e fornitori di tecnologia come Nvidia—senza dimenticare il vivace ecosistema di robotaxi emergente in Cina.

Tutti puntano sull’idea che il mercato della guida autonoma sarà immenso. Gli americani spendono attualmente circa 50 miliardi di dollari all’anno in servizi di ride-hailing. C’è poi la possibilità di vendere software di guida autonoma ai costruttori automobilistici e ai produttori di altri veicoli, come camion a lunga percorrenza e furgoni per le consegne. Dara Khosrowshahi, amministratore delegato di Uber, ha affermato che il mercato della guida autonoma potrebbe valere 1.000 miliardi di dollari o più solo negli Stati Uniti. Questo solleva due domande: quando la rivoluzione autonoma raggiungerà la massima velocità? E chi ne uscirà vincitore?

Per rispondere a queste domande bisogna partire dalla tecnologia. È facile dimenticare quanto sia straordinaria un’auto autonoma quando ci si siede su un Waymo o uno Zoox: ci si sente rapidamente così a proprio agio che ci si scorda che la propria vita è affidata a un computer su ruote. A differenza di altri robot che operano in ambienti puliti e controllati, come le fabbriche, i robotaxi devono affrontare il caos della vita quotidiana: automobilisti irritati, pedoni distratti, animali domestici e condizioni meteorologiche come la neve, che può essere soffice come fanghiglia o dura come un muro di mattoni.

Diverse innovazioni si sono combinate per rendere tutto ciò possibile. I robotaxi si affidano a sensori come telecamere, lidar laser, microfoni e radar per valutare le condizioni della strada, stimare le distanze e gestire la velocità. Usano poi l’intelligenza artificiale, sia a bordo del veicolo sia nel cloud, per imitare il modo in cui i conducenti umani elaborano queste informazioni e reagiscono ad esse. E con l’espansione dei servizi di robotaxi, è aumentata enormemente anche la quantità di dati raccolti, permettendo di perfezionare gli algoritmi. L’ascesa dei modelli multimodali di IA generativa, che uniscono testo, immagini e suoni, ha accelerato ulteriormente i progressi, anche facilitando l’addestramento dei sistemi autonomi tramite simulazioni e insegnando loro a reagire a situazioni insolite.

Per il settore, creare fiducia nella sicurezza dei veicoli autonomi è fondamentale. Una ricerca condotta lo scorso anno da Waymo insieme a Swiss Re, un gigante delle assicurazioni, ha mostrato che i suoi robotaxi hanno generato l’88% in meno di richieste di risarcimento per danni materiali e il 92% in meno di richieste per lesioni fisiche rispetto al guidatore umano medio, su un totale di 25 milioni di miglia percorse—una performance che da allora è ulteriormente migliorata. Ma la fiducia del pubblico è fragile. Un terribile incidente nel 2023 che ha coinvolto un robotaxi di Cruise, concorrente di Waymo, è diventato una minaccia esistenziale per l’azienda dopo che questa non ha fornito piena trasparenza durante un’indagine federale. General Motors, proprietaria di Cruise, ha poi chiuso il servizio.

Tali incidenti rischiano di rallentare gli sforzi dell’industria per conquistare i legislatori. Sotto la presidenza di Donald Trump, il Dipartimento dei Trasporti ha annunciato che svilupperà regolamenti federali per i veicoli autonomi, inclusi i robotaxi. Ma esistono ancora moltissime regole diverse da stato a stato (la California ne ha due agenzie regolatrici). Anche alcune città, come Seattle, pongono ostacoli. «Tutto ciò che facciamo oggi è volto a creare fiducia e sicurezza, e non possiamo sviluppare la tecnologia senza questo», afferma Chris Mooney, dirigente di Waymo.

Tuttavia, la rapidità con cui Waymo sta accelerando l’espansione città per città suggerisce che l’azienda è sempre più sicura della sicurezza del proprio servizio. Trasformarlo in un’attività redditizia, però, è un’altra questione. Si stima che i conducenti umani rappresentino il 50–70% del costo di un servizio di ride-hailing tradizionale come Uber, quindi eliminarli sembra un modo rapido per superare i concorrenti sui prezzi. Tuttavia, al momento tutti i servizi di robotaxi perdono denaro, incluso Waymo. (Oltre ai massicci finanziamenti ricevuti da Alphabet, l’azienda ha raccolto 5,6 miliardi di dollari da investitori esterni lo scorso anno.)

Ciò dipende in parte dal fatto che i veicoli sono costosi: sono dotati di funzioni di sicurezza costose e addestrati con chip di IA costosi. E a differenza dei servizi come Uber, che si basano su conducenti proprietari dei veicoli, gli operatori di robotaxi devono coprire i costi di acquisizione e gestione delle loro flotte, compresa la pulizia, il carburante, la manutenzione e il parcheggio. Inoltre, hanno bisogno di supervisori umani per monitorare i veicoli in caso di problemi.

Di conseguenza, Augustin Wegscheider della società di consulenza BCG stima che i veicoli autonomi costino circa 7–9 dollari per miglio da operare, contro i 2–3 dollari dei servizi tradizionali di ride-hailing e circa 1 dollaro per un’auto privata. Ridurre i costi «non è stata una priorità per le aziende di robotaxi finora», afferma Philipp Kampshoff di McKinsey. «Non hanno nemmeno iniziato, perché la missione numero uno era rendere l’operazione sicura.» McKinsey stima che ci vorrà un decennio per ridurre i costi a meno di 2 dollari per miglio.

L’hardware più economico contribuirà. Le stime del costo dell’attuale generazione di robotaxi Waymo variano dai 130.000 ai 200.000 dollari l’uno. Utilizzare come base la sportiva Jaguar I-Pace non ha contribuito a contenere i costi. Questo mese l’azienda ha iniziato a testare la Hyundai IONIQ 5, un modello più modesto, dotato della nuova generazione di tecnologia autonoma di Waymo che richiede meno sensori. Anche il costo di tali sensori sta diminuendo: i lidar prodotti negli Stati Uniti, che un tempo costavano circa 100.000 dollari, ora superano di poco i 1.000 dollari.

L’economia dei robotaxi può essere migliorata anche in altri modi. Per mantenere alta l’utilizzazione dei veicoli, Waymo ha scelto di distribuire un numero relativamente ridotto di taxi in diversi mercati, invece di saturarne uno solo—anche se la strategia ha limiti evidenti. Inoltre, sta iniziando a stringere alleanze con operatori di flotte come Avis per gestire le operazioni quotidiane.

Una volta che i robotaxi dimostreranno di essere sufficientemente sicuri e non più costosi di un taxi con conducente umano, la domanda potrebbe crescere rapidamente. La domanda successiva è chi conquisterà il mercato. Per ora Waymo è chiaramente in testa, almeno negli Stati Uniti. La sua tecnologia di guida autonoma è stata classificata come Livello 4, il che significa che nei territori pre-approvati i veicoli possono operare senza supervisione umana diretta, mentre i robotaxi di Tesla si collocano tra i Livelli 2 e 3, che richiedono ancora un supervisore a bordo. A causa della sua attenzione alla sicurezza, Waymo ha dotato i propri veicoli di hardware più costoso rispetto a Tesla. Ad esempio, i suoi ultimi modelli hanno 13 telecamere, sei radar e quattro lidar, mentre Tesla si affida esclusivamente a otto telecamere. Questo ha aiutato Waymo a conquistare la fiducia dei regolatori.

Ali Kani di Nvidia, che vende chip di IA a tutti i partecipanti alla corsa ai robotaxi, suggerisce che una volta che Waymo avrà dimostrato la sicurezza «senza intoppi», potrebbe essere in grado di ridurre i costi eliminando parte dell’hardware. Musk, invece, punta sul fatto che l’approccio di Tesla—basato solo su telecamere e software abilitatI dall’IA—gli darà un vantaggio man mano che la tecnologia migliorerà, rendendo i suoi robotaxi più economici di quelli di Waymo.

Per ora Waymo e Tesla mantengono la loro tecnologia strettamente riservata. Con il tempo, ciò potrebbe cambiare. Waymo potrebbe prendere esempio da un’altra iniziativa di Alphabet—il sistema operativo Android—e cercare di concedere in licenza il proprio software. Musk ha dichiarato che potrebbe fare lo stesso con la tecnologia di guida autonoma di Tesla. Aicha Evans, amministratrice delegata di Zoox, afferma che l’azienda intende rimanere un servizio di robotaxi completamente integrato. Ma alcuni ritengono che la sua tecnologia autonoma potrebbe essere utilizzata anche nelle operazioni logistiche di Amazon. Altre aziende, come Wayve, una startup britannica sostenuta da Nvidia e SoftBank, hanno scelto di concentrarsi sul software di guida autonoma invece di offrire un servizio integrato di robotaxi, con tutti i costi e la complessità che ciò comporta. All’inizio di quest’anno Wayve ha annunciato che avrebbe iniziato a vendere la sua tecnologia a Nissan, un produttore automobilistico giapponese.

I fornitori di robotaxi dovranno anche decidere come collaborare con le grandi aziende di ride-hailing, in particolare Uber. Nel 2020 Uber ha abbandonato il tentativo di sviluppare la propria tecnologia autonoma, ma da allora punta a diventare la piattaforma di riferimento per le prenotazioni di robotaxi. In alcune città, come Phoenix, già accetta prenotazioni per conto di Waymo. Altrove spera di competere direttamente. Ha stretto un accordo con il produttore di veicoli elettrici Lucid e con Nuro, sviluppatore di sistemi autonomi, per distribuire 20.000 robotaxi nei prossimi sei anni. Intende anche entrare nel mercato londinese in collaborazione con Wayve e un costruttore automobilistico non ancora annunciato.

Uber scommette che i conducenti umani e i robotaxi coesisteranno per molti anni ancora. Tuttavia, alla lunga, i robotaxi diventeranno l’opzione più economica, afferma Sarfraz Maredia, responsabile dell’autonomia di Uber. Ecco perché l’azienda si sta posizionando ora. La sua vasta base di clienti le offre un enorme vantaggio: secondo Sensor Tower, Uber conta 42 milioni di utenti attivi mensili, molto più di Waymo.

Infine c’è Nvidia. Non sorprende che il più grande beneficiario della rivoluzione dell’IA stia conquistando un ruolo essenziale come fornitore per i veicoli autonomi. Insieme a Uber, sostiene i costruttori automobilistici che stanno sviluppando sistemi autonomi propri, tra cui Mercedes-Benz e Stellantis (il cui principale azionista, Exor, possiede una quota della società madre dell’Economist). Allo stesso tempo, vende enormi quantità di processori grafici (GPU) a Waymo per svolgere le sue simulazioni di IA e per essere installati nelle auto, dove elaborano i dati provenienti dai sensori e calcolano le reazioni del veicolo. Tesla ha ugualmente speso miliardi di dollari per addestrare i suoi sistemi di IA su 100.000 GPU Nvidia. Non sarà un robotaxi con il marchio Nvidia a passare a prendere i clienti. Ma l’azienda più preziosa del mondo si assicurerà certamente la sua parte della corsa. ■

ПОЛНЫЙ ПЕРЕВОД НА РУССКИЙ ЯЗЫК

В 1995 году исследователи Университета Карнеги–Меллон проехали 3 000 миль от Питтсбурга до Сан-Диего, ни разу не положив руки на руль. Тур под названием «No Hands Across America» стал началом долгого пути к автономному вождению в Америке. Тридцать лет спустя, наконец, можно увидеть плоды этого пути — быстрое распространение беспилотных такси в нескольких городах США. Скоро им предстоит испытание менее предсказуемой погодой — и левосторонним движением — в Лондоне и Токио.

Количество американских городов, включённых в карту развития роботакси, быстро растёт. Waymo, принадлежащая Alphabet и располагающая крупнейшим в мире парком из 2 500 автономных автомобилей, предоставляет платные поездки в пяти местах — Атланте, Остине, Лос-Анджелесе, Финиксе и районе залива Сан-Франциско — и планирует более чем удвоить это число в следующем году. Tesla Илона Маска расширила свою примитивную услугу роботакси (в машине всё ещё присутствует «наблюдатель безопасности») из Остина в Сан-Франциско. Zoox, компания, принадлежащая Amazon, создала необычное такси без руля и педалей и уже предлагает автономные поездки в Лас-Вегасе и недавно запустилась в отдельных районах Сан-Франциско. Как существо пушми-пуллу из книг доктора Дулиттла, этот автомобиль может двигаться в обе стороны.

Многие люди по-прежнему испытывают беспокойство по поводу такой технологии. Согласно недавнему опросу YouGov, три четверти американцев заявили, что почти не доверяют беспилотным такси. Однако их сомнения, возможно, частично связаны с отсутствием личного опыта. Другое исследование, проведённое компанией J.D. Power, показало, что уровень доверия был на 56 процентных пунктов выше среди тех, кто уже пользовался роботакси, чем среди тех, кто не пробовал. А число людей, которые решили попробовать такую поездку, быстро растёт. В апреле Waymo превысила отметку в 1 млн активных пользователей в месяц, по данным Sensor Tower — это в десять раз больше, чем два года назад.

Waymo и её конкуренты — не единственные компании, которых манит потенциал этой технологии. К ним присоединяются традиционные сервисы поездок по вызову, такие как Uber, автопроизводители вроде Mercedes-Benz и Volkswagen, а также технологические компании, включая Nvidia — не говоря уже о бурно развивающейся экосистеме роботакси в Китае.

Все они рассчитывают, что рынок автономного вождения будет огромным. Американцы тратят около 50 млрд долларов в год на поездки с водителем. Кроме того, существует возможность продавать программное обеспечение для автономного вождения автопроизводителям и производителям других транспортных средств — например, грузовиков дальнего следования и фургонов для доставки. Руководитель Uber Дара Хосровшахи заявил, что рынок автономных технологий может стоить 1 трлн долларов или больше только в США. Это поднимает два вопроса: когда автономная революция выйдет на полную скорость и кто станет её лидером?

Чтобы ответить на эти вопросы, нужно начать с технологии. Когда находишься внутри Waymo или Zoox, легко забыть о техническом чуде — всё выглядит настолько привычно, что начинаешь забывать, что твоя жизнь находится в руках компьютера на колёсах. В отличие от роботов, работающих в чистых контролируемых условиях, например на заводах, роботакси сталкиваются с хаосом реальной жизни — агрессивными водителями, рассеянными пешеходами, домашними животными и погодными условиями, такими как снег, который может быть мягким, как каша, или твёрдым, как кирпичная стена.

Несколько инноваций сделали это возможным. Роботакси полагаются на камеры, лазерные лидары, микрофоны и радары, чтобы оценивать дорожную ситуацию, определять расстояния и управлять скоростью. Далее они используют искусственный интеллект — как в машине, так и в облаке — чтобы имитировать то, как человеческие водители обрабатывают информацию и реагируют на неё. И по мере расширения роботакси-сервисов, объём получаемых данных резко вырос, что позволяет совершенствовать алгоритмы. Рост многомодальных генеративных моделей ИИ, объединяющих текст, изображения и звук, также ускорил прогресс, облегчая обучение автономных систем в симуляциях и помогая им реагировать на необычные ситуации.

Для отрасли важно обеспечить общественное доверие к безопасности таких автомобилей. Исследование, проведённое Waymo совместно со Swiss Re, показало, что роботакси компании на 88 % реже становились участниками аварий с материальным ущербом и на 92 % реже — с травмами по сравнению с обычными водителями, на пробеге 25 млн миль. С тех пор показатели ещё улучшились. Но доверие общества легко потерять. В 2023 году один из беспилотников компании Cruise попал в ужасное ДТП, а после того, как фирма не предоставила полную информацию федеральным следователям, кризис стал для неё почти смертельным. Владеющая Cruise компания General Motors закрыла свой сервис роботакси.

Такие инциденты могут замедлить попытки отрасли заручиться поддержкой политиков. Министерство транспорта США при администрации Дональда Трампа заявило, что разрабатывает федеральные правила для автономных автомобилей, включая роботакси. Однако всё ещё существует множество различий в правилах между штатами (в Калифорнии роботакси регулируют две разные структуры). Некоторые города, такие как Сиэтл, тоже ставят препятствия. «Всё, что мы делаем сегодня, направлено на построение доверия и безопасности. Мы не можем масштабировать технологию без этого», — говорит Крис Муни, руководитель Waymo.

Тем не менее скорость, с которой Waymo разворачивает свою сеть город за городом, показывает растущую уверенность компании в безопасности своего сервиса. Но превращение этого в прибыль — совсем другое дело. Считается, что работа водителей составляет 50–70 % стоимости поездки в сервисах вроде Uber, поэтому идея устранить водителей кажется быстрым способом снизить цены. Однако сегодня все компании роботакси работают в убыток, включая Waymo. (Помимо крупных вливаний от Alphabet, компания привлекла 5,6 млрд долларов от внешних инвесторов в прошлом году.)

Это частично объясняется дороговизной машин: они оснащены дорогостоящим оборудованием безопасности и обучаются на дорогих ИИ-чипах. И в отличие от Uber, который использует автомобили, принадлежащие водителям, операторы роботакси должны сами приобретать и обслуживать свои парки — включая расходы на уборку, топливо, обслуживание и парковку. Им также нужны человеческие операторы, следящие за работой машин.

По оценкам Августина Вегшайдера из консалтинговой компании BCG, эксплуатация беспилотника стоит 7–9 долларов за милю — против 2–3 долларов у обычных сервисов и 1 доллара у частного автомобиля. «Снижение затрат не было приоритетом для роботакси-компаний», — говорит Филипп Кампсхофф из McKinsey. — «Они даже не начали эту работу, потому что их первой задачей было обеспечение безопасности». В McKinsey считают, что понадобиться около десяти лет, чтобы снизить стоимость до 2 долларов за милю.

Удешевление оборудования поможет. Стоимость современных машин Waymo оценивается в 130 000–200 000 долларов за штуку. Использование спортивной Jaguar I-Pace в качестве основы не помогло экономии. В этом месяце компания начала тестировать более скромную модель Hyundai IONIQ 5 с обновлённой системой автономного управления, требующей меньше датчиков. Стоимость датчиков тоже падает: лидары американского производства, стоившие раньше около 100 000 долларов, сейчас стоят чуть более 1 000.

Экономику роботакси можно улучшить и другими путями. Чтобы поддерживать высокую загрузку машин, Waymo предпочитает размещать небольшое количество такси в нескольких городах, а не полностью доминировать на одном рынке — хотя у этой стратегии есть пределы. Компания также начинает сотрудничать с операторами автопарков, такими как Avis, чтобы делегировать часть ежедневных операций.

Когда роботакси докажут, что они достаточно безопасны и не дороже обычного такси, спрос может резко вырасти. Тогда возникнет вопрос: кто победит? Сейчас лидером в США является Waymo. Её технология автономного вождения имеет классификацию уровня 4 — это значит, что авто может ездить без человеческого участия в заранее разрешённых зонах. У Tesla уровень 2–3, поэтому в машине всё ещё должен сидеть человек-наблюдатель. Благодаря ориентации на безопасность автомобили Waymo оснащены более дорогими компонентами, чем Tesla. Например, их последние версии оснащены 13 камерами, шестью радарами и четырьмя лидарами, тогда как Tesla использует только восемь камер. Это помогает Waymo легче проходить регуляторные проверки.

Али Кани из Nvidia — компании, продающей ИИ-чипы всем конкурентам в гонке за роботакси — считает, что если Waymo докажет свою безопасность «без сбоев», компания сможет сократить расходы, убрав часть оборудования. Маск, в свою очередь, полагает, что стратегия Tesla — полагаться только на камеры и программное обеспечение на базе ИИ — даст компании преимущество, поскольку технология будет становиться лучше, а машины — дешевле, чем у Waymo.

Пока что и Waymo, и Tesla держат свои технологии в секрете. Со временем ситуация может измениться. Waymo может вдохновиться другой инициативой Alphabet — операционной системой Android — и начать лицензировать своё ПО. Маск говорил, что Tesla может поступить так же. Айша Эванс, генеральный директор Zoox, заявила, что компания намерена оставаться полностью интегрированным сервисом. Но некоторые считают, что её автономная технология может использоваться и в логистике Amazon. Другие фирмы, такие как британская Wayve, поддерживаемая Nvidia и SoftBank, предпочли сосредоточиться на разработке программного обеспечения, а не полном сервисе роботакси с его затратами и сложностью. В этом году Wayve объявила, что начнёт продавать свою технологию автопроизводителю Nissan.

Поставщикам роботакси также предстоит решить, как работать с крупными компаниями такси-приложений, прежде всего с Uber. В 2020 году Uber отказался от разработки собственных автономных технологий, но теперь стремится стать предпочтительной платформой для бронирования роботакси. В некоторых городах, например в Финиксе, Uber уже принимает бронирования для Waymo. В других местах компания рассчитывает конкурировать напрямую. Она заключила соглашение с производителем электромобилей Lucid и компанией Nuro, создающей автономные системы, о развертывании 20 000 роботакси в ближайшие шесть лет. Также Uber планирует выйти в Лондон в партнёрстве с Wayve и ещё одним автопроизводителем, который пока не назван.

Uber уверен, что человеческие водители и роботакси будут сосуществовать ещё многие годы. Тем не менее со временем роботакси станут более дешёвым вариантом, говорит Сарфраз Маредия, глава подразделения автономии Uber. Именно поэтому компания стремится занять место на этом рынке уже сейчас. Её огромная клиентская база даёт ей преимущество: по данным Sensor Tower, у Uber 42 миллиона активных пользователей в месяц — намного больше, чем у Waymo.

И наконец, есть Nvidia. Неудивительно, что крупнейший бенефициар революции ИИ занимает ключевое место как поставщик оборудования для автономных автомобилей. Вместе с Uber Nvidia поддерживает автопроизводителей, которые создают свои автономные системы — в том числе Mercedes-Benz и Stellantis (крупнейший акционер последней, Exor, владеет долей в материнской компании The Economist). Параллельно Nvidia продаёт огромное количество графических процессоров (GPU) Waymo для работы её ИИ-симуляций, а также оснащает ими машины, где они анализируют данные с датчиков и принимают решения. Tesla тоже потратила миллиарды долларов на обучение своих ИИ-моделей на 100 000 GPU Nvidia. Это не будет роботакси Nvidia, которое будет забирать клиентов. Но самая дорогая компания мира обязательно возьмёт свою долю с каждой поездки. ■
